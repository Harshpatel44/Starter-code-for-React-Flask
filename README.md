<h2>Starter-code-for-React-Flask</h2>
<p>This Repository contains the starter code for working with React as frontend and Flask as backend framework.</p>
<p>"npm modules" folder is removed, which can be created with command "npm install" in React.</p>
<p>This code shows the post request from React to Flask and returning back the response.</p>
<p>Both React and Flask are running on the same server, hence Flask renders React pages.</p>
